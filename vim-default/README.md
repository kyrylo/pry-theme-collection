Vim Theme for Pry
=================

For those familiar with vim's unchanged color scheme.

I figure it's useful to have consistency.

Once I find a really good 256-color vim theme, I'll port that to pry as well
(though, without patches, the CodeRay gem has the limit that it doesn't
distinguish between various keywords or types of strings, so it won't be easy
to make subtle variations.)
